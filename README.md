# Interactive-Data-Science-Web-App
An interactive python streamlit web application to analyze accidents in New York City. This project got me familiar with pydeck which is the open source visualization software from Uber and also Streamlit which helped create the interactive webpage. I have updated this readme to acknowledge the fact the CSV file for this application is no longer accessible. The code for the application is still there and if the file was still accessible, I would give instructions on how to run the application. This was an awesome project to build upon my knowledge of numpy and pandass with two new libaries and I will be playing around with both. I am not the author of this code this was a guided project from Coursera.
